/**
 * @brief The QUIT command is used to terminate a clientâ€™s connection to the server. 
 *  The server acknowledges this by replying with an ERROR message and closing 
 *  the connection to the client.
 * 
 * 	When connections are terminated by a client-sent QUIT command, 
 *  servers SHOULD prepend <reason> with the ASCII string "Quit: " when sending 
 *  QUIT messages to other clients, to represent that this user terminated the 
 *  connection themselves. This applies even if <reason> is empty, in which case 
 *  the reason sent to other clients SHOULD be just this "Quit: " string. 
 * 	
 *  Parameters: [<reason>]
 * 
 *  Example : [CLIENT] QUIT :Gone to have lunch   
 * 			  [SERV] ;Client exiting from the network
